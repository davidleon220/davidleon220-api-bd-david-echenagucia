# Music Library Management API

This project is a Music Library Management API, developed using Node.js, Express, Sequelize as the ORM, and PostgreSQL as the database. The API allows users to manage a collection of artists and their songs. It provides endpoints to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) both artists and songs, as well as retrieve songs by a specific artist. The project also includes a React-based frontend for an intuitive user interface, enabling easy interaction with the music library data.
